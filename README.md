_"If you had not committed great sins, God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you. If you're afraid - don't do it, - if you're doing it - don't be afraid! an action comitted in anger is an action doomed to failure. Who can't stop drinking may get drunken three times a month."_ Genghis Khan
